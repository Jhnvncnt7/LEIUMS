**Laboratory Equipment Inventory and Usage Management System (LEIUMS)** <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Laboratory Equipment Inventory and Usage Management System is a C++-based program developed to efficiently manage, track, and analyze laboratory equipment data. It records essential details such as equipment name, quantity, acquisition date, and condition, while performing computations related to usage hours, depreciation, and availability rates. The system assists laboratory personnel in maintaining accurate inventory records, monitoring equipment lifespan, and planning timely repairs or replacements. By integrating programming logic, computation, and file handling, this project demonstrates the engineering application of structured programming for optimizing laboratory resources.
